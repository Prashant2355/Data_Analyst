# Bank Marketing Predictive Analysis
<b>Description</b> :- The data was related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution where the marketing campaigns were based on phone calls.
<b>Objective</b> :- Predict whether the client will subscribe to a term deposit.

<b>Contribution</b> :-
Utilized data preprocessing techniques to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
Employed all possible machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, naive bayes, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, gradient boosting and extreme gradient boosting for predictive modeling.
Conducted feature engineering to identify the most influential variables for subscription prediction.
Evaluated models trained under each machine learning algorithms using various metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, precision, specificity, AUC-ROC, F1 score.
<b>Conclusion</b> :- The model trained under Extreme Gradient Boosting gave best overall performance for prediction.
<b>Tools</b> :- Jupyter Notebook.
<b>Technologies</b> :- Python(Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn), Machine Learning(Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and Extreme Gradient Boosting).
